    This is a bit of a hacky way to do it, but because Eleventy does not support Nunjucks block declarations, this is how you can add an author's note to a page!

    This author's note supports **Markdown Formatting**, much like the rest of the comic's page. Make sure your author's note is space-indented, not tab-indented, or else your compiler is going to have issues.
