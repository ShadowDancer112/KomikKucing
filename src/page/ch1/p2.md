Here is page 2 of chapter 1 of your webcomic!

By default, your pages will be sorted in alphabetical order. Folders on a "lower" directory level may be placed earlier than files within subfolders of the `src/page` directory. If you have all of your files numbered, then they should be ordered numerically - page 1 → page 2 ... → page 9 → page 10 → page 11, et cetera.

This hierarchy is easiest to wrap your head around if all files are on the same "level" of folders. For example, all pages are placed without a folder in the `page` directory, or pages are divided into `chapter1`, `chapter2`, etc. folders.
